# COP4331_Project2_TTT
Tic-Tac-Toe From command line

- Build and Run from the course.oop.main.TTTDriver.java file.
- Program will initially ask for user input for the answers to "how many players?" and their corresponding username(s) and marker(s).
- AI is default as Player 2 with the username "computer" and a marker of "O".
- GUI is interactable through inputting corresponding integers according to the menu options that appear.
- the board is displayed and formatted to only fit one character markers even though markers are strings.

- My "Game", "Player", and "AI" classes are slightly different from the UML diagrams as a few methods were added to accomodate the methods in the interface.
- As <other> directory was renamed to "classes" to accomodate Game, Player, and AI classes.
